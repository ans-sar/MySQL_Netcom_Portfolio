# MySQL_Netcom_Portfolio
Welcome to my MySQL portfolio, a collection of projects and exercises completed during my NCFE Level 3 Certificate in Data Analytics from Netcom Training. This portfolio highlights the fundamental concepts of MySQL, including data creation, manipulation, and querying techniques. Throughout these tasks, I've learned how to design and interact with relational databases, gaining hands-on experience that has solidified my understanding of database principles. Whether it's creating tables, writing SQL queries, or optimizing database performance, this portfolio reflects my journey and growth in mastering the essentials of MySQL.
